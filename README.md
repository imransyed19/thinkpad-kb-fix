# ThinkPad keyboard fix
ThinkTwice is a small Windows .NET app which replaces {PrtSc} key press with right mouse click.

More precisely - with the {Shift}{F10} key combination, which corresponds to the {Menu} button,
which was blatantly replaced with Print Screen button on newer ThinkPad models.
All experienced Windows users who are using keyboard on a laptop could benefit from such a possibility, as many got used to this extremely helpful button.
