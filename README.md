# ThinkTwice keyboard fix
ThinkTwice is a Windows app which replaces {PrtSc} key press with right mouse click.

More precisely - with the {Shift}{F10} key combination, which corresponds to the {Menu} button,
which was replaced with Print Screen button on newer ThinkPad models.

## Use
Launch the ThinkTwiceKeyboardFix.exe
The key stays remapped as long as the windows remains open.
You might wish to launch it on startup.
